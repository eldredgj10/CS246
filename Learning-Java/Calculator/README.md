## Number input
The prompt accepts any type of number because it is stored as a float in the program. This means that the numbers could be real numbers and decimals.
The program handles the display of the numbers according to their remainders. For example, If 10.0 is inputed the computer will write it as 10. This is shown in the displays of the equation.


## Choice selection
After entering the numbers in the prompt, the next prompt asks for a symbol that represents the type of math the computer needs to do. The symbols are +, -, *, and /.
